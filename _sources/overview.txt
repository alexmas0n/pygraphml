GraphML
-------

`GraphML`_ is a comprehensive and easy-to-use file format for
graphs. It consists of a language core to describe the structural
properties of a graph and a flexible extension mechanism to add
application-specific data. Its main features include support of

- directed, undirected, and mixed graphs,
- hypergraphs,
- hierarchical graphs,
- graphical representations,
- references to external data,
- application-specific attribute data, and light-weight parsers.

Unlike many other file formats for graphs, GraphML does not use a
custom syntax. Instead, it is based on XML and hence ideally suited as
a common denominator for all kinds of services generating, archiving,
or processing graphs.

PyGraphML
---------

PyGraphML is a small library designed to parse GraphML files. This
library has been written in Python. It's main feature are:

- reading GraphML file and getting consistant graph accessible in Python.
- write a graph object to a GraphML file.
- flexible attributes management.
- graph visualization using `NetworkX`_
